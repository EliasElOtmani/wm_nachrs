# ABSTRACT #
############

This project corresponds to a research work performed at the Laboratoy of Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience (LNC2) of the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure of Paris, in the Team Mathematics of Neural Circuits of Pr. Boris Gutkin. 
The corresponding thesis is included in the folder.

This code is almost entirely object-oriented. The four important classes are : 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* NeuralPop.py :	Stands for a Neural Population, which also includes the nested class Synapse. This class functions as an input-output object which can be interconnected with other Neural Populations.

* CCM.py : 	Canonical Cortical Model, this class stands for a model of supragranular prefrontal circuitry. It uses interconnected Neural Populations and generates (and stores) Simulations.

* Simulation.py :	Recording of simulated neural traces over time. Its postproc function allows to return the corresponding summary statistics. 

* DMTS.py : 	The Delayed Match-To-Sample task, it uses CCMs and generates Simulations according to defined task parameters. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the heavy computations (i.e., simulations) were performed on the parallel computing cluster of the LNC2, "Frontex". The cluster runs on functions defined on the following scripts :  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* dmts_frontex.py

* helper_frontex.py :	These two scripts generate simulations for DMTS analysis

* infer_frontex.py : 	For simulating data with random models for further inference
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, the repository includes the following Jupyter Notebooks : 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* DMTS_analysis.ipynb 		Analysis of DMTS simulations 

* infer_on_presim_data.ipynb 	Perform Approximate Bayesian Computation

* div_modulation.ipynb 		Study of neural subpopulation response functions
